# TuneCapsule [Name subject to change]

`TuneCapsule` helps discerning music listeners catalog their all-time
library. As they encounter new music, they simply enter a rating for
each album or single into `TuneCapsule`, saving it to a persistent
database. Then `TuneCapsule` will take playlists and keep them updated
as more music is ranked. Currently supports Spotify.
