    The "Street Cred" Score (v1.0)
    -----------------------
    If a project is less than 15 minutes and has fewer than 5 tracks, it is considered a (multi-)single. The ranking will be converted to a score and multiplied by the number of tracks. "A" rankings get 1.8 points/track, "B" rankings get 1.0 pt/trk, and "C" rankings get 0.2 pt/trk.

    All other projects are considered albums and will be scored at the calculated value times the ranking point value (1.8, 1.0, or 0.2). Albums recieve a base value plus up to two length bonuses. The base value is the duration of the album divided by the general average duration of a song, fixed at 3 min 30 sec. All albums below 63 minutes (but at least 15 minutes) recieve a 1 point value bonus, and all albums at least 30 minutes recieve a seperate 1 point value bonus. In other words, albums from 30 minutes to below 63 minutes recieve two bonus value points, while all other albums recieve one bonus value point.

    Each point corresponds to one minute. The score is the amount of

    maintains a high quality level.

    To find the score, sort all known projects of an artist in reverse

    projects are included and 2) at least 70% of the playtime included
    is on an A ranked project. Once the range has been established,
    calculate the total duration of the projects in minutes to find the
