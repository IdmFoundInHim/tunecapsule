    """Associates a playlist with certain rankings or a certification

    The subject will be **overwritten** to hold songs in chronological
    order of release holding a minimum ranking or given certification.
    The query describes a time range and certification. An optional
    first word, "update", changes this behavior to modify playlists that
    have been previously assigned.

    The query includes a year (e.g. 2019) or year range (e.g.
    1999-2019), and then all subsequent words are classifications.If the
    classification is a number, the playlist is used to hold a part of
    the year's songs ranked A or B. Otherwise, the playlist holds all of
    the year's (or range's) songs with at least one of the
    classifications. The year can be omitted if the classification is
    not a number to get all songs.

    For example, "season 2020 3" would hold about 80 songs from the
    middle of 2020 that were ranked A or B. Meanwhile, "season 2020 B"
    would hold however many songs were ranked B from 2020, but none
    ranked A. "season 2020 C ðŸ”‚" would include C-ranked songs from 2020
    as well as ðŸ”‚-certified songs from that year.

    The location of the playlist on Spotify will also be saved in the
    database alongside the selected classifications. This allows later
    use of "season update" to add any newly-classified projects to the
    playlist. For instance, if more projects were ranked in 2020 after
    making a 2020-3 playlist, running "season update 2020 3" would add
    those projects to the existing playlist (keeping release order)
    until the playlist is about 80 songs. Alternatively, "season update
    2020" would edit all the previously created 2020 numbered playlists
    (like 2020-1 or 2020-12), potentially moving projects between
    playlists to sort them by release order.

    Broad uses of "season update" or "season update *year*" will create
    playlists with predictable names (e.g. "2010--2017" or "2014-3") to
    fill gaps in the sequence. They will not, however, change the names
    of existing playlists. Only the unlimited "season update" will
    automatically create and remove year ranges (which will not delete
    the playlists on Spotify). Ranges of more than one year must
    encompass only whole years.

    A "season" is, in general, the set of projects having one of the
    given classifications and being released during the given date
    range. Each season's metadata includes the classification(s), date
    range, and a Spotify playlist ID. Metadata is stored in the
    database, while the contents are gathered as needed. Numeric
    classifications (e.g. "1" and "12") represent the set of
    classifications {"A", "B"} and inform this sentence to automatically
    calculate an end and start date.

    Note that *year* ranges are inclusive-inclusive (r[0] <= n <= r[1]) while *day* ranges are inclusive-exclusive (r[0] <= n < r[1], like the `range` builtin)
